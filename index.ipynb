    "> Yes, it's pretty confusing, but the important thing to take away is that we need to run our cells with Python code by pressing `shift + enter` if we want Python to read our variables and functions and remember them later on. Remember, in the case of assignment, the return value is `None`, which does not show an output. We can see this more concretely below by running the cell below:"

Then we will ask you to work with data stored in those variables.  To avoid going to the top of the lab to press `shift + enter`, it's best just to press that while reading along. \n",

    "The same thing goes for working through a Readme.  The Readmes will often assign data to variables, and it may be nice to work with data stored in those variables later on.  So it's a good idea to press `shift + enter`, and now that you know how to work with Jupyter notebooks, you can always modify the notebooks with new code to test your understanding."

    "In this lesson, we learned about Jupyter notebooks.  We saw that in Jupyter notebooks, we can either be in insert mode or escape mode.  While in insert mode, we can edit the cells and undo changes within that cell with `command + z` or `ctl + z`.  In escape mode, we can add cells with `b`, delete a cell with `x`, and undo deletion of a cell with `d`.  We can also change the type of a cell to markdown with `m` and to Python code with `j`.  \n",
